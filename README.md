## About Tessa E-Commerce

This is an E-Commerce site where users and hairstylists can buy hair products and items from Tessa Consulting, a market store based in Gostivar, North Macedonia.
This is a server-side web application with all the functionality and features of modern E-Commerce sites. It will be used in the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) sense where data about the products will be retrieved from the main company database and that same data will be displayed to the users of the site who can purchase the products. 

This project was made using the **Laravel Framework**.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Using Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

1.	**Front-end:** The front-end is the user interface of the e-commerce system. It consists of the website application that customers use to browse products, place orders, and interact with the e-commerce system. The front-end will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

2.	**Back-end:** The back end is responsible for the processing and management of data. It consists of server-side applications and the database that stores customer information, product data, and order history. The back end is built using the Laravel Framework.

3.	**Database:** The database is where all the data of the e-commerce system is stored. This includes customer information, product data, and order history. The database management system that is in use in our case is MySQL.

4.	**Payment gateway:** The payment gateway is a secure system that handles the process of collecting and processing payment from customers. It integrates with the back end of the e-commerce system and communicates with the payment processor to confirm the payment and complete the transaction.
